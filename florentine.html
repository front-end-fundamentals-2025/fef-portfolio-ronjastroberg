          <h2>MODERN</h2>
          <p class="text-modern">
            While the Italian Cuisine is traditional, the idea behind this
            identity was to embrace traditionality yet giving it modern twist,
            making it fit in with the Scandinavian more modern and minimalistic
            style. Combining the traditional Florence elements in the logo
            together contemporary patterns and illustrations created a unique
            vibe.

          <h2>MEMORABLE</h2>
          <p class="text-memorable">
            The idea was to create a memorable identity and logo that make
            people remember the place and the feelings they experienced while
            being there. By mixing traditional and playful elements I hope to
            deliver a setting and a feeling that people will talk about and want
            to come back to. Scandinavian style merged with Italian cooking is
            the best of both worlds and those worlds are capsuled in this
            restaurant.

          <h2>PLAYFUL</h2>
          <p class="text-playful">
            To create a unique visual identity I added colors that reminds me of
            when I lived in Florence. All inspiration for this project comes
            from my own experience and I wanted to bring the happy feeling I got
            there back to Sweden and the identity of this restaurant. Adding fun
            colors and illustrations gives the identity a depth and gives the
            restaurant an personality.
